# airtack
A Python script built on top of the Aircrack suite to automate the process of attacking a WPA2 protected WiFi network.

Run the airtack python script and enter the corresponding information when asked, or type -h to view the command line interface switches that can set variables before beginning. If the deauthorization attack goes well and the password is in the dictionary you specified, then you should end up with a cracked WPA2 password. Happy hunting.

This script is only to be used in environments that are owned by the individual running the script, or where permission has been obtained prior to beginning the test. Running this script on a network without the permission of the owner of that network is not tolerated.
