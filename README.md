# airtack
A Python script built on top of the Aircrack suite to automate the process of attacking a WPA protected WiFi network.

Run the airtack python script and enter the corresponding information when asked. If all goes well and the password is in the dictionary you specified, then you should end up with a cracked WPA2 password. Happy hunting.
